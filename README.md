CRUD App with Hooks
Create a *datatable* (table component) using React Material UI (https://material-ui.com/) and populate it with data (sample users) from REQRES public API (https://reqres.in).
It is having following features:
1. Pagination (Hint: Since REQRES dataset is small, limit items per page to 3 or 4)
2. Sorting (users/data should be sortable with ID)
3. Search (users/data should be searchable with name or email)
4. On clicking single item/row, Open a modal/dialog with full details of that user (i.e. show avatar and other details)
5. Add new User
6. Edit User details
